# Session Handoff - Phase 3B Data Layer

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Phase:** Phase 3B - Data Layer Integration & Testing
**Status:** Moving from Phase 3A (foundation) to Phase 3B (testing & integration)

## What to Tell Claude in New Chat

```
We're working on Phase 3 of the Dashie app rebuild - the Data Layer.

Please read `.reference/build-plans/Phase 3 - Data Layer.md` to understand what we've
completed (Phase 3A) and what's next (Phase 3B).

We just finished building the authentication foundation with dual-write pattern for tokens.
Now we need to TEST that the dual-write actually works (saves to Supabase, not just
localStorage) and then build the initialization system.

Start by reviewing the "IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK" section in the Phase 3 build plan.
```

## Quick Context

**What We Just Finished (Phase 3A):**
- ✅ Two-layer auth architecture (account login vs calendar API access)
- ✅ Google OAuth (web + device flow) working and tested
- ✅ TokenStore with dual-write pattern code (NOT TESTED)
- ✅ EdgeClient for edge function calls
- ✅ Environment config (dev/prod detection)
- ✅ Fixed auth header format (Authorization: Bearer)
- ✅ Moved auth-config.js to js/data/auth/

**What's Next (Phase 3B):**
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Test dual-write pattern (does it actually save to Supabase?)
2. Build initialization system (proper app startup sequence)
3. Build auth orchestration layer (session-manager, auth-coordinator)
4. Apply dual-write to settings

**Current Branch:** main (all work committed)

**Key Files:**
- `js/data/auth/token-store.js` - Dual-write token storage (needs testing)
- `js/data/auth/edge-client.js` - Edge function client
- `js/data/auth/auth-config.js` - Environment config
- `.reference/build-plans/Phase 3 - Data Layer.md` - Complete guide
- `.reference/architecture.md` - Overall architecture (updated 2025-10-17)

## Recent Changes Made

1. **Moved auth-config.js** from `js/auth/` to `js/data/auth/`
2. **Updated all imports** in affected files
3. **Updated architecture.md** to reflect Phase 3 status
4. **Updated Phase 3 build plan** with current status and next steps

---

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Dual-write not tested** - TokenStore has code but we don't know if it works
2. **EdgeClient initialization** - Chicken-and-egg problem with JWT token
3. **No initialization system** - Need modular startup sequence

## Files Ready for Next Session

All files in `js/data/auth/` are ready and working for Phase 3A functionality.
Next session should focus on testing and integration, not building new auth code.
