## üîß Technical Details

### Edge Function Configuration

The `DELETION_CONFIG` in the edge function controls which tables are deleted:

```javascript
const DELETION_CONFIG = {
  tablesToDelete: [
    'user_photos',
    'user_storage_quota',
    'user_settings'
  ],
  tablesWithStorage: [
    { 
      table: 'user_photos', 
      storagePathColumn: 'storage_path',
      bucket: 'photos'
    }
  ],
  enableDiscoveryMode: true  // Warns about tables not in config
};
```

### Safety Features

1. **Two-step confirmation:** Warning screen + modal
2. **Discovery mode:** Logs tables with `auth_user_id` not in deletion config
3. **Error handling:** User-friendly error messages
4. **Automatic sign-out:** Prevents dashboard errors
5. **Local storage cleanup:** All dashie-* and user-* keys removed

### D-pad Navigation Support

- Both Cancel and Delete Account buttons are focusable
- Cancel button has default focus (first in list)
- Delete Account button shows red outline when focused
- Enter key triggers click event
- Escape key closes modal

---

## üé® UI/UX Design

### Color Scheme
- **Warning Header:** Red (#FF3B30)
- **Warning Text:** Normal (black/white depending on theme)
- **Delete Button Text:** Red (#FF3B30)
- **Delete Button Focus:** Red outline with light red background
- **Cancel Button:** Normal iOS style

### Focus Order
1. Cancel button (default - safest option)
2. Delete My Account button

### Modal Behavior
- Overlay darkens background
- Escape key closes modal
- Click outside does NOT close modal (safety)
- Cancel button closes modal
- Delete Account button proceeds with deletion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Edge Function Deployment

**The edge function MUST be deployed separately to Supabase:**

```bash
# From your Supabase project directory
supabase functions deploy database-operations
```

The file is located at:
```
.reference/Supabase Edge Functions/database-operations.js
```

### Adding New User Tables

When you add a new table with user data:

1. Add table name to `DELETION_CONFIG.tablesToDelete`
2. If table has storage bucket files, add to `tablesWithStorage`
3. Keep `enableDiscoveryMode: true` during development
4. Check logs for warnings about unconfigured tables

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Edge function deployed to Supabase
- [ ] Navigate to Delete Account screen
- [ ] Verify warning text displays correctly
- [ ] Test Cancel button (both screen and modal)
- [ ] Test D-pad navigation (up/down arrows)
- [ ] Test Delete Account button shows modal
- [ ] Test modal Cancel button
- [ ] Test Escape key closes modal
- [ ] Test full deletion flow with test account
- [ ] Verify automatic sign-out works
- [ ] Verify local storage is cleared
- [ ] Check database records are deleted
- [ ] Check storage files are deleted

## üêõ Known Issues / Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Discovery mode requires manual SQL function (not yet implemented)
- Storage deletion is best-effort (continues even if some files fail)
- No undo or recovery mechanism (by design)

### Potential Enhancements
- Add email confirmation before deletion
- Add cooling-off period (e.g., 30-day soft delete)
- Export user data before deletion
- Send deletion confirmation email
